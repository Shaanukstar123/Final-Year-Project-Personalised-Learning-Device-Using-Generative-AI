I Spy and Shopping Basket are great time wasters and even can test your spelling or memory.  In I Spy a player gives the first letter of the object as a clue. For example, if it's wall, they say, \"I spy with my little eye something beginning with W\". Everyone takes turns to guess until someone gets the right answer. Shopping basket involves each player adding an item to the list, for example saying, \"I went to the shop and bought some milk\", then \"I went to the shop and bought some milk, lettuce...\" and memorising all the items as they are added - until the list gets so long no one can remember! But have you tried '20 Questions' where you think of a celebrity and the other passengers have to guess who you are by only asking 20 \"yes\" or \"no\" questions?  Another favourite is the number plate game - you might have your own version of the number plate game, but ours goes like this:  Write down the full alphabet on a piece of paper. Then tick off the letters when you spot a number plate that starts with them.  The first to complete the whole alphabet wins! Be prepared, it could take a good few hours!  Take it in turns with the people in the car to add to a dramatic story.  Start it with \"Once upon a time there was a....\" and see what the next person comes up with.  It can be as creative, wild and imaginative as you like, and it always works well if you leave an exciting cliff hanger moment for the next person to continue.  Does the unicorn manage to escape from clutches of the evil princess? Is there a dramatic twist coming?  It's up to the next person to decide so see where the story leads!  You can go around the group as many times as you like, so let your imaginations run riot, and why not add a Christmassy theme to your tale?

These   are different to the spiky ones we usually see because they are softer and furry.  This new discovery shows how even in well-studied animal groups, like mammals, there is still more to be uncovered.  The five new species belong to a group of soft-furred hedgehogs called lesser gymnures, that live in Southeast Asia and before it was thought there were only two species.  The study which made the discovery used modern techniques to examine the hedgehog specimens from museum collections.  The team looked at 232 physical specimens and 85 tissue samples for genetic analysis from across the entire soft-furred hedgehog group.  The results confirmed that there were then five new species.  The team is excited by the discovery because it shows there is still so much to learn about the natural world.  \"It might be surprising for people to hear that there are still undiscovered mammals out there. But there is a lot we don't know - especially the smaller nocturnal animals that can be difficult to tell apart from one another,\" said Melissa Hawkins, curator of mammals at The National Museum of National History, in the US.  Soft-furred hedgehogs are small mammals, but unlike the rest of the hedgehog family they are furry rather than spiky.  Arlo Hinckley, lead author of the study, says without the spiky spines, they look a bit more like a mix of a mouse and a shrew with a short tail.  These new species are active in the day and night and enjoy eating a diverse mix of insects and some fruits.  \"Based on the lifestyles of their close relatives and field observations these hedgehogs likely nest in hollows and take cover while foraging among tree roots, fallen logs, rocks, grassy areas, undergrowth and leaf litter,\" says Hinckley.  \u00a9 2024 BBC.

Experts say that the turtle dove and the hazel dormouse are among those facing an uncertain future in the UK.  They added that factors such as  , intensive farming and pollution are all putting pressure on our wildlife. The State of Nature report was put together by more than sixty organisations, including wildlife conservation groups, government agencies and academics. It looked back at around fifty years of research and found that natural spaces and the wildlife that depends on them are in decline. Numbers of plants and animals monitored since the 1970s have decreased by an average 19%. Researchers say that the most at-risk groups included birds, amphibians and reptiles, fungi and land mammals.  Species affected include the turtle doves, water voles, lady's slipper orchids and European eels.  More than half of plant species have also declined and researchers have also warned that most of Britain's important natural habitats are in a poor condition - including woodland, wetlands and wildflower meadows. We need to move far faster as a society towards nature-friendly land and sea use.  Beccy Speight, RSPB chief executive The report found that intense farming and the effects of climate change, are having the biggest impacts on our wildlife.  At sea and on the coast, the main pressures on nature are unsustainable fishing, climate change and the way coasts and sea beds are looked after. Conservation organisations say more investment and a shift to much more wildlife-friendly farming and fishing are urgently needed. In England, an estimated 70% of land is farmed. Beccy Speight from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said that the report should make everyone \"sit up and listen\". Beccy also argued that restoring nature would also help to tackle the climate crisis: \"We need to move far faster as a society towards nature-friendly land and sea use. \"Otherwise, the UK's nature and wider environment will continue to decline and degrade, with huge implications for our own way of life.\" The government has said it is committed to \"increasing the amount of habitat for nature to thrive\". It added that it was investing in its \"30-by-30\" pledge, to protect 30% of land for nature by 2030. Currently only about 11% of UK land is within protected areas, and the report says not all of it is well managed for nature and wildlife. \u00a9 2024 BBC.

Her absence from the sport means Raducanu, who is 21, has fallen to 296 in the world rankings. She was awarded a wildcard to take part in Auckland, which means she's able to compete without having to play qualifying matches, and without having to be ranked at a particular level. \"It's pretty amazing to just be out here and playing,\" Raducanu said today. \"I'm just really happy to be back on the tour and can't wait to start this season and carry on hopefully injury-free and healthy.\" Raducanu now faces a tougher task as she is due to play Elina Svitolina - one of the world's best players - in the second round. Emma Raducanu began playing tennis when she was just five-years-old.  She started playing for Team GB juniors when she was 14 and in 2017, she made her first appearance at a junior grand slam event - Wimbledon. She became the British junior number one when she was 15.

It's not like the rainforests you may have seen pictures of in other parts of the world, though. The kind of rainforest that can be grown here is called temperate rainforest, and is sometimes known as Atlantic woodland or Celtic rainforest. It used to cover huge parts of west Britain and Ireland and is very mossy.  However, over the years it has reduced significantly due to things like overgrazing from sheep, invasive species and nitrogen pollution., and now only small pockets of this type of forest remain. In fact in England, just 189 sq km (46,624 acres) now survives. The strategy includes working with local farmers and landowners to help restore the unique ecosystems, and to prevent grazing by deer, which inhibits its recovery. Environmental organisations such as Wildlife Trusts, Woodland Trust, RSPB, National Trust and Plantlife have been campaigning for a long time for this to happen, and are very pleased at the announcement. Guy Shrubsole, who leads the Lost Rainforests of Britain campaign, told The Guardian it's really cool that people are starting to talk about this issue: \"Before 2021, no politician had even mentioned temperate rainforests in the UK parliament. Now, the government themselves have not only mentioned it, they've actually devoted entire official policy documents to this habitat.\"  He went on to say that while the announcement is \"exciting\", he wants a further target to be set to double the area of British rainforests by 2050. Joan Edwards, director of policy for the Wildlife Trusts, said: \"Temperate rainforest is a globally rare habitat that was once one of the jewels of Britain's nature crown.  \"We welcome the government's intention to invest in temperate rainforest restoration and management, as part of protecting 30% of land by 2030, and look forward to a more detailed strategy in the coming months.\" The forestry minister Rebecca Pow, who is the person in the government responsible for issues related forests and woodland, said campaigners have been inspiring on helping bring light to this issue, and that she looks forward to working with them on it in future. She added: \"The UK is home to globally rare temperate rainforests supporting rich native habitats and rare species and plants. Most of our temperate rainforests are centuries old and form an important part of our natural heritage. It is vital they are supported and protected for future generations.\" \u00a9 2024 BBC.

They have been studying an environment in Argentina, which is home to giant mounds of rocks, which were built by microbes, called stromatolites. Those behind the study say the stromatolites found in this area are \"unlike any others found on modern Earth\". Astrobiologist Dr Brian Hynek, was part of the team that studied the site in Puna de Atacama in Argentina, and examined some of the earliest fossils in rocks there. He says they were created at a time when all life on Earth was microscopic, there were no plants or animals and there wasn't any oxygen to breathe either.  He said: \"We think there are the same types of bacteria living there and doing the same biology processes as the ones billions of years ago. \"So by studying the modern ones, we can learn about early Earth life.\" Not many places still have stromatolites similar to those around on ancient Earth. Dr Hynek says that stromatolites might have formed on Mars and would like to see them searched for by rovers. He says the dried up lakes on the planet have a lot of the same salts that the team found in samples from their study in Argentina. The team only had a couple of hours at the site on its first trip and are hoping to return.

{"id": 67871973, "name": "Longest NHS doctors strike: What you need to know", "content": "That's because thousands of junior doctors across England are taking part in a six-day strike which begins today - the longest strike action to take place in  .  is organised by the British Medical Association (BMA) which represents doctors and medical students in the UK, and is happening because of arguments with the government over their pay and working conditions. NHS bosses have said the strike will have a big impact on routine services - things like like planned operations, in hospitals. This is because many senior doctors will be moved from working in routine services to more urgent areas, like A&E (Accident and Emergency) to make sure that people can still get help in an emergency.  junior doctors have taken part in 28 days of strike action, which will go up to 34 after the current strike ends.  Before that, other NHS staff, including nurses and ambulance staff, were also involved in strike action. Over the past year more than 1.2 million appointments and treatments have had to be cancelled because of the strikes. Lots of junior doctors in England are striking over their current pay.  The BMA says junior doctors have seen a significant decrease in their salaries over the last 15 years  .  Inflation is when the cost of goods and services increases over a period of time, making them more expensive. This can have an impact on what people can buy with the money they make from their jobs.  Inflation refers to the rise in the cost of goods and services over a period of time. The BMA argues that pay rises for junior doctors haven't been in line with the rising rate of inflation since 2008.  It also says the pay issue is making it harder to both hire and keep junior doctors in England, which is having a knock-on effect on the number of doctors working in the NHS.  The BMA is requesting a 35% pay rise for junior doctors in England, but the government has said it can't afford this.  Pay isn't the only reason doctors are striking.  Some say their working conditions are also not ideal and they're not receiving the support they need because lots of doctors across the NHS are currently leaving the profession.  Speaking about the current strike, NHS England medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis said the NHS was facing  a \"very challenging\" start to a year, due to the strikes and a rise in illness due to the winter. The government's Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said junior doctors should call off their strike and \"come back to the negotiating table so we can find a fair and reasonable solution to end the strikes once and for all\". Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi who are BMA junior doctors committee co-chairmen said the government needed to come forward with a \"credible offer\". \"Doctors would have liked to start the new year with the hope of an offer on pay that would lead to a better-staffed health service and a better-valued profession.\" In Wales, junior doctors are due to take part in strike action later in January, while in Northern Ireland a vote is taking place over strike action. In August, a pay deal was reached with junior doctors in Scotland. It includes a 12.4% pay increase for 2023/24, and a wage rise of 4.5% for 2022/23 with government ministers also promising to talk about future pay increases. \u00a9 2024 BBC.

Speaking after the game, Littler was looking to the future: \"I've got to the final, I might not get to another final for the next five to 10 years, we don't know, but I can say I'm a runner-up and now I just want to go and win it.\"  At the age of 16, Littler is the youngest player to reach the final of the World Darts Championship, the biggest event in the sport.  He started playing darts when he was just 18 months old when his parents bought him a magnetic board.  This video can not be played Watch: Luke Littler plays darts as a toddler in home video footage He said: \"There's a video on YouTube of me when I was 18 months in a nappy listening to Raymond van Barneveld's music and doing his celebrations. \"It's crazy watching myself at 18 months or two years old in a nappy, but it has all paid off.\" Littler moved on to a big darts board when he was five and he has never looked back, winning lots of tournaments at all age levels. He is the current world youth champion and has claimed 12 adult titles already.  His rise to the top has been incredible. Just two weeks ago, he made his debut at the world championships where the crowd sung \"You've got school in the morning\". In the semi-final on Tuesday, they sung \"Walking in a Littler wonderland\". He's a huge football fan - a Manchester United supporter - and has met several top Premier League players in the past week. He was even a guest at Tottenham when they played Bournemouth on Sunday, sitting alongside England's James Maddison. Would you believe omelettes and pizza?  Littler has kept to the same routine during the world championships - and that means eating the same food every day. He said: \"In the morning I'll go for my ham and cheese omelette and then come here, have a pizza and then prep on the board. That is what I've done every day.\" He says he loves to finish the day with \"a kebab and a can of Tango\". While Littler missed out on the top prize of \u00a3500,000, he still earned \u00a3200,000 for reaching the final. Not bad for someone who started the tournament ranked 164th in the world! Adam McMillan, headteacher at Littler's former school Padgate Academy near Warrington, says lots of pupils have been inspired to take up darts. He told the Guardian newspaper: \"He's putting darts on the map at the moment but he's already done that here at the school. \"He's left such an incredible legacy at the school, lots of students have been inspired by him and gone on to be interested in darts. \"He's left his mark here but I think the wider impact will be seen in schools across the UK, we'll see some sort of legacy from all this.\" \u00a9 2024 BBC.

The earthquake was a 7.6 in magnitude, which caused damage to houses and roads in central Japan, with some buildings collapsing completely.  People were also warned about a big tsunami - which is a large wave caused by an earthquake. On Monday afternoon in Japan - which was around 7am in the UK - a big earthquake struck on the west coast of the country's main island.  The worst impact was on the The Noto Peninsula, in the Ishikawa Prefecture. Shaking from the earthquake was felt as far as the capital of Tokyo, which is around 300km away from the epicentre.  People were also warned about a potential tsunami, but waves did not end up being as high as predicted. Tsunamis can happen after an earthquake.  Movement in the Earth's plates causes big vibrations in the ground for people on land - and then large movements in the waves out at sea.  When these movements cause a big wave, it's called a tsunami.  Tsunamis can be very dangerous - water moves very quickly and can damage buildings, vehicles and roads.  People in places like Japan, where there can be lots of will be warned about a tsunami before it happens so they can head somewhere safe. Firefighters in Japan have been tackling fires caused by damaged electrical wires and movement from the earthquake. The shaking caused some buildings to collapse completely, and people had to be rescued from the rubble.  It's now time for a big rescue mission - there's currently over 1,000 rescuers searching for people that could be trapped because of fallen buildings.  Lots of people are staying in shelters across the country, after they were told to leave their homes to stay safe from the earthquake. Whilst it can be quite common for there to be small tremors in Japan, a big earthquake like this one is quite rare.  When the Earth's plates move against each other and create things like earthquakes and volcanoes, it's called tectonic activity. Japan is in an area with lots of tectonic activity. Underneath Japan, there's lots of different tectonic plates meeting and rubbing against each other, which can lead to lots of earthquakes.  Because of this, kids in Japan learn earthquake safety in school, and some buildings are designed to cope with lots of shaking and moving.  However, in less developed areas, earthquakes can cause a lot of damage. Big earthquakes like this one can also lead to damage in places that are very well protected. \u00a9 2024 BBC.

They will also be joined by Emma Myers, and Danielle Brooks - who will be playing Dawn - and Sebastian Eugene Hansen - who will be playing Henry.  The movie will be directed by Jared Hess - who worked with Jack Black in one of his previous movies Nacho Libre. Minecraft is one of the best selling video games of all time, with 300 million copies sold and nearly 140 million people playing it each month. Over the last ten years, a variety of directors such as Shawn Levy (who directed Night at the Museum)   (who  ) were signed up to work on the movie, but it didn't work out. Filming is set to start \"imminently\" on the movie, but no details of the official plot have been revealed just yet. \u00a9 2024 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."}

Story:
Once upon a time in the bustling town of Scienceville, there lived a curious little girl named Lily. Lily adored everything about science, from the stars that twinkled in the night sky to the tiny ants that scurried along the ground. One day, while exploring the forest near her home, Lily stumbled upon a mysterious glowing rock.

Intrigued, Lily carefully picked up the rock and examined it closely. It shimmered with a brilliant green light, filling her with wonder. Determined to learn more, Lily decided to take the rock to her friend, Professor Wiz, the wise old scientist who lived on the edge of town.

Professor Wiz welcomed Lily into his laboratory with a warm smile. Together, they studied the glowing rock under a powerful microscope. "Ah-ha!" exclaimed Professor Wiz. "This rock is actually a rare mineral called phosphorescentite. It absorbs light energy from its surroundings and then releases it slowly over time, creating that beautiful glow."

Eager to learn more, Lily asked, "But why does it glow, Professor Wiz?"

The professor chuckled, delighted by Lily's curiosity. "Well, you see, Lily, inside the phosphorescentite are tiny particles called phosphors. When these phosphors absorb energy from light, they become excited and jump to higher energy levels. But they can't stay there forever! Eventually, they return to their normal state, releasing the extra energy in the form of light, which is what makes the rock glow."

Lily listened intently, soaking up every word. With Professor Wiz's guidance, she conducted her own experiments with the phosphorescentite, learning all about light energy and the fascinating world of minerals.

From that day on, Lily continued her scientific adventures, always asking questions and seeking answers. And as she explored the wonders of the natural world, she knew that there was always more to discover, thanks to the power of curiosity and the magic of science.

Story:
Once upon a time, in the heart of the British Isles, there existed a rich tapestry of history woven with tales of kings and queens, conquerors and poets, heroes and villains. Let us embark on a journey through time to explore the captivating story of British history.

Our tale begins in ancient times, when Celtic tribes roamed the land, their druids whispering secrets to the winds and their warriors defending their clans with fierce loyalty. These early Britons left behind mysterious stone circles and towering hill forts, symbols of their connection to the earth and the sky.

But the winds of change were blowing across the sea, bringing with them the arrival of the Romans. Led by the mighty Julius Caesar, they sought to conquer the island and claim it as their own. And conquer they did, building great cities like Londinium and Bath, and leaving behind roads and walls that still stand to this day.

Yet the Romans were not destined to rule Britannia forever. As their empire crumbled, new invaders arrived on the shores of Britain—the fierce Anglo-Saxons from across the North Sea. Led by warriors like King Alfred the Great, they carved out kingdoms of their own, each with its own customs and traditions.

But just as the Anglo-Saxons settled into their new homeland, a new threat emerged from the east—the Vikings. These fierce warriors, known for their longships and battle axes, raided the coastlines of Britain, spreading fear and destruction wherever they went. Yet they also left behind a legacy of trade and exploration, their influence felt in the language and culture of the land.

Amidst the chaos of invasion and conquest, a new power began to rise—the Kingdom of England. Led by kings like William the Conqueror and Henry II, England grew into a mighty realm, its borders expanding with each passing year. Yet it was not without its struggles, as kings clashed with barons and peasants revolted against oppression.

As the Middle Ages gave way to the Renaissance, Britain entered a new era of enlightenment and discovery. It was a time of great minds and great deeds, as scholars like William Shakespeare and scientists like Isaac Newton made their mark on the world. Meanwhile, across the sea, explorers like Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh set sail for distant lands, their ships carrying the flag of Britain to the farthest corners of the earth.

But with great power came great conflict, and Britain soon found itself embroiled in wars both at home and abroad. From the English Civil War to the Napoleonic Wars, from the Industrial Revolution to the Victorian Era, the story of Britain was one of triumph and tragedy, of progress and sacrifice.

And so, as we reach the end of our journey through British history, let us pause to reflect on the lessons we have learned. For in the annals of time, we find not just the story of a nation, but the story of humanity itself—a tale of courage and resilience, of hope and perseverance, that continues to inspire us to this day.

In the heart of the British Isles lies a storied land steeped in history, where each cobblestone street whispers tales of triumph and turmoil, of kings and commoners, of empire and rebellion. Come, let us embark on a journey through the annals of British history, tracing the footsteps of those who shaped the destiny of a nation.

Our tale begins in the mists of antiquity, when ancient tribes roamed the land, leaving behind enigmatic monuments like Stonehenge, a testament to their mastery of the earth and the heavens. But it was the arrival of the Romans that marked the dawn of recorded history in Britain. Led by the indomitable Julius Caesar, they brought with them the grandeur of empire, building roads, walls, and cities that would stand as testament to their might for centuries to come.

Yet the Romans were but one chapter in the saga of Britain. With the fall of the empire came the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons, fierce warriors from across the sea who carved out kingdoms of their own amidst the ruins of Roman Britain. It was a time of war and upheaval, as the Anglo-Saxons clashed with the native Britons and each other for control of the land.

But out of the chaos emerged a new order—the Kingdom of England. Led by kings like Alfred the Great and William the Conqueror, England grew into a formidable realm, its borders expanding with each passing year. Yet it was not without its struggles, as kings grappled with barons, and peasants rose up against oppression.

As the Middle Ages gave way to the Renaissance, Britain entered a new era of enlightenment and exploration. It was a time of great minds and great deeds, as scholars like William Shakespeare and scientists like Isaac Newton ushered in a golden age of creativity and discovery. Meanwhile, across the seas, explorers like Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh ventured into the unknown, their exploits fueling the fires of British ambition and expansion.

But with great power came great conflict, and Britain soon found itself embroiled in wars both at home and abroad. From the English Civil War to the Napoleonic Wars, from the Industrial Revolution to the Victorian Era, the story of Britain was one of triumph and tragedy, of progress and sacrifice.

Yet through it all, the spirit of Britain endured—a spirit of resilience and determination, of innovation and adaptation. From the halls of Westminster to the streets of London, from the rolling hills of Scotland to the valleys of Wales, the story of Britain is a testament to the power of human endeavor, a tale of a nation that rose from the ashes of history to become a beacon of hope and inspiration for the world. And as we reflect on the journey that has brought us to this moment, let us remember that the story of Britain is not just a story of the past, but a story that continues to unfold with each passing day, shaping the destiny of generations yet to come.

Fueled by resentment and despair, a new leader rose to power—the charismatic and enigmatic Adolf Hitler. Promising to restore Germany to its former glory, Hitler's Nazi Party seized control, plunging Europe into a maelstrom of fear and uncertainty.

As Hitler's ambitions grew, so too did the specter of war. In 1939, the world held its breath as Germany invaded Poland, sparking a conflict that would engulf the globe in flames. From the blitzkrieg tactics of the German army to the air raids that rained terror from the skies, World War II brought death and destruction on an unprecedented scale.

Yet amidst the darkness, there were rays of light—stories of heroism and defiance that inspired hope in the hearts of millions. From the beaches of Dunkirk to the streets of Stalingrad, ordinary men and women rose to extraordinary heights, risking their lives to resist tyranny and defend freedom.

In the Pacific, a sleeping giant awakened as the United States entered the fray, determined to avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor and bring an end to Japanese aggression. From the jungles of Guadalcanal to the shores of Iwo Jima, American forces fought with unwavering resolve, turning the tide of war in the Pacific theater.

But victory came at a terrible cost, as the world counted the human toll of war in millions of lives lost. From the Holocaust to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the scars of World War II would forever mark the collective consciousness of humanity, a grim reminder of the horrors that mankind is capable of unleashing upon itself.

Yet even in the darkest hours, there were glimmers of hope—a newfound resolve to build a better world from the ashes of the old. In 1945, the guns fell silent as the Allies emerged victorious, ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity. And as the world came together to rebuild and renew, the lessons of World War II would serve as a beacon of hope for generations to come, a reminder of the enduring power of the human spirit to overcome even the greatest of challenges.

Story:
In the hushed predawn hours of June 6, 1944, the fate of the world hung in the balance as the largest amphibious invasion in history unfolded on the shores of Normandy, France. This was D-Day, a day that would go down in history as a turning point in World War II—a day of courage, sacrifice, and the triumph of the human spirit against overwhelming odds.

As the first light of dawn broke over the horizon, Allied forces from the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and other nations descended upon the beaches of Normandy, their hearts pounding with anticipation and fear. In the air above, paratroopers dropped from the sky, their silhouettes dark against the pale glow of the morning sky.

Among the brave soldiers landing on the beaches was Sergeant James Anderson, a young American from Ohio. With his rifle in hand and his comrades at his side, Sergeant Anderson stormed ashore amidst a hail of enemy gunfire, his heart filled with determination to liberate Europe from the grip of tyranny.

The beaches of Normandy were a scene of chaos and carnage, as Allied troops fought tooth and nail to establish a foothold on French soil. Wave after wave of soldiers surged forward, braving machine gun fire, artillery barrages, and the treacherous waters of the English Channel.

Story:
Imagine waking up on a sunny Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, on the beautiful Hawaiian island of Oahu. It was a day like any other, with families in their cozy beds, and the world felt peaceful. But little did they know that the skies were about to be filled with planes, and the ocean with battleships.

Pearl Harbor, a bustling harbor and home to the United States Pacific Fleet, was suddenly the center of something huge. This harbor was like a floating city with battleships, airplanes, and brave sailors. That morning, when many people were still in their pajamas, the sky echoed with loud noises and thick smoke, and the sea was in chaos. The heroes of Pearl Harbor, the sailors and soldiers, were faced with a huge challenge. The attackers came from far-off Japan, and they wanted to surprise America and stop it from getting in their way. They thought it would be easier to do this when nobody was expecting it.

But why did Japan attack? It all began with a long and complicated history. Japan was a country that wanted to grow and be powerful. They felt that they needed more land and resources to do that. So, they started a war with China, called the Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1937. They wanted to take over parts of China to get more of what they needed.
Japanese planes swooped down from the sky like a flock of angry birds. They dropped bombs and torpedoes on the ships and the harbor. It was very loud, and the explosions made the water splash high into the air. The ships in the harbor suffered greatly.
One of the most famous ships that was hit was the USS Arizona. This mighty battleship was almost like a floating fortress, and it was named after the state of Arizona. When it was struck, a huge explosion occurred, and the ship sank beneath the waves. The heroes on board, many of whom were trapped, became a symbol of bravery and sacrifice.
Another ship, the USS Oklahoma, also faced a terrible fate. It was capsized by the torpedoes and turned upside down. Brave sailors worked tirelessly to rescue their friends trapped inside the ship.
The USS California and the USS West Virginia were also damaged, but they would eventually be repaired and returned to the fight.
The USS Nevada, though heavily damaged, managed to get underway. It was the only battleship that could move during the attack. Its heroic crew fought hard to prevent the ship from falling into enemy hands.
The heroes of Pearl Harbor didn’t back down in the face of this unexpected and devastating attack. They were brave, just like superheroes in a comic book.
American fighter planes, like the P-40 Warhawks, took to the air to engage the incoming Japanese attackers. In this epic dogfight, American pilots displayed incredible courage and determination as they fiercely defended their homeland. These brave men engaged the enemy, maneuvering through the sky with great skill, attempting to protect their ships and harbor from further destruction. While they faced overwhelming odds, their unwavering commitment and heroism left a lasting mark in the history of the attack on Pearl Harbor, as they fought valiantly in the face of adversity.
Many heroes displayed great courage during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
First, there were the brave men who were on the ships and in the airplanes. They had to be quick and smart to defend their country. They didn’t give up, even when things looked tough.
Then there were the amazing nurses. These were kind and caring women who worked in the hospitals. When the attack happened, they didn’t run away; they stayed to help the wounded soldiers and sailors. They worked tirelessly to make sure everyone was okay.
One of these nurses was named Annie. She said, “I’m here to take care of you. Everything will be okay.” She smiled and gave comfort to those who were hurt. Annie and many other nurses showed incredible kindness.

The President at the time, Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke these famous words on the radio, 

“Yesterday, December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy… the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.” In his speech, Roosevelt expressed the shock and anger felt by the entire nation. He went on to say, “No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.” With these words, he assured the American people that they would stand strong and united against this unexpected attack, and they would eventually prevail. Roosevelt’s speech became a rallying cry, inspiring Americans to come together and work toward victory in World War II.

After the attack, people from all over America heard about what happened at Pearl Harbor. They wanted to help too. Many young men joined the army and the navy to protect their country. They were devastated by the attack on Pearl Harbor, especially those who lost loved ones. But it also made them very determined. The people of America decided they would work together and become even stronger. They remembered the heroes of Pearl Harbor, and they were inspired to do their best for their country.

In the years that followed, America and its allies joined together to fight Japan and the Axis Powers in what became World War II. It was a tough time, but the brave spirit of the heroes at Pearl Harbor lived on. Men and women across the country built airplanes, ships, and tanks. They planted victory gardens to grow food and were careful how they spent their money. Some donated their money to help the war effort. Everyone did their part to help their country.

With time, the heroes of Pearl Harbor became a symbol of courage and unity. They showed the world what it meant to be brave and never give up, even when times are tough.

In the end, America and its allies won the war, and they celebrated their victory. The heroes of Pearl Harbor, the men, women, and nurses, were remembered as true American heroes. They showed that when people work together, they can overcome even the biggest challenges.

Today, people still remember Pearl Harbor every year on December 7. They gather to honor the heroes and remember the day that changed America. It’s a day to think about the importance of peace and working together.

If you visit Pearl Harbor in Oahu, Hawaii today, you can still see the battleship, USS Arizona sunken just below the surface of the water. I’ve visited there multiple times and am always shocked to think of what happened there, but also spend the time honoring those who gave their lives in service to their country. And now the USS Arizona Memorial, floating solemnly above the sunken battleship, is a powerful symbol of remembrance and honor in the heart of Pearl Harbor. The memorial, which stands as a graceful white structure, is designed to gently straddle the ship’s sunken remains. Visitors from all over the world come to pay their respects and remember the heroes who perished in this historic tragedy.

As you step onto the USS Arizona Memorial, a hushed reverence fills the air. You can see the clear waters through the openings on the floor, a solemn window into the past. Inside, a wall bears the names of the brave men who lost their lives on the ship, a poignant reminder of their sacrifice. The memorial serves as a place of reflection and contemplation, reminding us of the importance of peace and unity. It’s a place where we honor the heroes of the USS Arizona and all those who came together during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor, illustrating the enduring spirit of resilience and togetherness.

Have you ever imagined what it must be like to be President of the United States? You’d have to govern an entire country! Just think, you would sign laws that affect over 300 million people. You would be in charge of one of the strongest militaries in the world. You would give speeches to millions of people!

Now, imagine if you had to do all of that from a wheelchair. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the thirty-second President of the United States, had to use a wheelchair because his legs were paralyzed. This meant that he couldn’t walk or even stand. How did that happen, you may be asking? And how did he still become president regardless of his challenges despite that? Let’s rewind and find out!

Roosevelt grew up on a large farm in New York State. Since he lived in the country, Roosevelt was taught at home by tutors when he was young. Because of this, he didn’t have a lot of friends his age, and he was very shy. 

But Roosevelt was close with his family. He also had a distant older cousin named Teddy who he really admired. Teddy was outgoing and popular. When Roosevelt started high school, Teddy announced that he wanted to become a politician. A politician is someone who gets elected to a government position. 

That sounded pretty cool to Roosevelt. He decided he wanted to be a politician just like his cousin. What he didn’t realize is that to be a politician, he’d have to talk to large crowds of people. He’d have to get those crowds to like and trust him. That meant A LOTa lot of socializing.

There was one big problem: Roosevelt was not particularly social. He had a hard time making friends. He preferred to spend his time reading books and studying. He studied so hard, in fact, that he got accepted into Harvard just as his cousin Teddy had done. Harvard was a top college and a good choice for people who wanted to study law. 

While Roosevelt was in his first year at Harvard, his cousin Teddy became the most important politician in the country: he was elected President of the United States. If you want to learn more about Teddy Roosevelt be sure to look up our episode about him. Roosevelt was proud of his cousin, no doubt. But how could he compete with him? Roosevelt decided to work even harder. He was determined to keep up with his superstar older cousin and forge his own path to the presidency. 

As president, Teddy made hundreds of decisions every day! People counted on him to keep the country safe. To be elected, he’d had to convince millions of people that he was the best person for the job. But Teddy had always been popular.

Being popular was not something Roosevelt had ever been very good at. 

He was not athletic. He always cared more about grades than being cool. How could he get his classmates at Harvard to like him? He hatched a plan. He started to join clubs and meet people. He even became the editor of the Harvard Crimson newspaper!

As editor of this newspaper, Roosevelt reported on events that happened not just on campus but around the world. He began to learn more about politics and the government. He started to realize which politicians he agreed with and which ones he didn’t. His cousin Teddy was a Republican, but Roosevelt decided he would prefer to be a Democrat.  

Roosevelt married a woman named Eleanor and graduated with a law degree. He was ready to give politics a try. So, when he was twenty-eight, he ran in an election to be a state senator for New York and won. As a senator, Roosevelt helped create and vote on laws for his state. Being a state senator was a good first step. But Roosevelt still had more work to do. 

After only one two-year term as a state senator, Roosevelt received a life-changing call! It was the new President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson. Wilson asked Roosevelt to move to Washington D.C. to help run the United States Navy. This was huge! Roosevelt was excited to take this job. 

His dream of being president suddenly seemed within reach. Roosevelt’s career was moving in the right direction. He was getting experience in politics and learning about different parts of government. He was meeting important politicians. He was even gaining popularity among Americans. His dream of being president was within reach. 

Then, in 1921, Roosevelt went to New York for a family vacation. One day, he was relaxing on a boat, when without warning, he fell into the ice-cold water. His legs felt numb. Soon after that, he felt lots of pain in his back and his legs. He started to lose control of his body. He couldn’t even move his face. For a short period of time, he was almost entirely paralyzed and unable to move any parts of his body.

The doctors told Roosevelt that he had a disease called polio. This disease affected his spinal cord, which is what allowed his arms, legs, and all the other parts of his body to move. It was unusual for an adult to get polio. Since there was no cure for it, Roosevelt thought that he would never be able to move again.

How was Roosevelt ever going to control a country or command a military if he couldn’t move? He couldn’t stand. He couldn’t walk. He couldn’t even wave or smile at people. It seemed like his political career was over.

However, Roosevelt did not want this disease to decide when he should retire. He wanted to stay in politics. He was determined wanted to become president. Roosevelt decided that he would fight to recover to reach his goal. Nobody knew how long it would take or if it was even possible! And he’d be away from politics for a long time. Would anybody remember him after he was away for so long?

He needed people to remember his name. He had an idea. His wife, Eleanor, was well-liked and very intelligent. Maybe his wife could help remind people of his accomplishments in political circles. Plus, he could write letters to important politicians all over the country. He would make sure he wasn’t forgotten.

It took Roosevelt years to recover. He had to work hard to regain the use of his body parts. Roosevelt had to learn how to move again by swimming. Since he weighed less in the pool, it was easier for him to try lifting his arms and legs again. At first, he needed a lot of help, but he did get stronger. He had braces fit for his legs that allowed him to stand up.

By 1928, Roosevelt had made a lot of progress. He had built back a lot of his muscles, but he was still paralyzed in his legs. He realized he would never be able to walk again. Could he be the powerful, admirable figure that past presidents like his cousin were known for if he was stuck in a wheelchair?

Roosevelt did what he’d always done: use his intelligence and determination to make progress his hard work. In 1928, seven years after he first got sick, Roosevelt made his political comeback as Governor of New York. 

This same job title had belonged to his older cousin Teddy almost 30 years earlier. Roosevelt’s path to the presidency was back on track. 

Just like Teddy, Roosevelt was well-liked by the people of New York. He ran for re-election in 1930, and he won again. He liked being governor, but still, he wanted a promotion. He wanted to be president.

In 1932, Roosevelt ran for president of the United States. He won the election by beating Herbert Hoover. He became the thirty-second President of the United States, joining the long line of famous, powerful presidents, including his older cousin Teddy.  

Roosevelt didn’t let a wheelchair stop him. He did all of the things that presidents are supposed to do. He showed his country and the world that he was a strong and capable leader. When he gave speeches, Roosevelt used leg braces, a cane, and usually the arm of a family member to walk to the podium. Instead of using the bulky, ugly wheelchairs of the time, Roosevelt built his own sleek wheelchair using a dining chair with bicycle wheels attached to it. He could even climb stairs using just the strength of his arms like a gymnast!

Roosevelt showed the country that a disability did not mean he couldn’t be just as powerful and admirable as any other president. In fact, he served nearly four terms, making him the longest-serving president in history! 

Fortunately, a few years later, a scientist named Jonas Salk discovered a cure for polio. His vaccine made it so no one had to go through what President Roosevelt did. 

Roosevelt’s path to the presidency was not an easy one. But he never gave up on his dream or his desire to match Teddy’s success. Sometimes, being the younger cousin isn’t such a bad thing, after all.

Story:
If you are like me, you like to go on trips with your family.  Maybe you like to go to a local park, the ocean, or a nearby mountain.  On these trips, did you ever find someplace that made you go “Wow!” because it was so big or beautiful – something that you had never seen before and was truly spectacular?  Well, today we’re are going to talk about amazing places on earth that were made by Mother Nature rather than man; 7 places around the world made by water, wind, and fire, things so big and amazing you can hardly believe them.  What do you think they are?  We’ve talked about one of them in a previous episode.  Can you guess what it is?  It is very tall and covered in snow.  If you said Mount Everest, you’re right!

So, let’s learn more about the 7 wonders of the natural world – and do it in alphabetical order!  


Aurora Borealis
First on our list is the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights.  This is a fancy name for a beautiful light show in the sky.  In very cold places like Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Canada, Alaska, Russia, and other places, the night sky can be lit up by beautiful waves of flowing green, pink, red, and yellow colors.  Think of an ocean wave and how it ripples with different colors of blue, green, turquoise, and tan when you look at it.  Well, that’s what it looks like in the sky, but with bright colors!  And you may wonder what causes these amazing ripples of color across the sky.  Well, the sun spits out these little particles, called ions.  It’s like the sun spitting out little peas.  The ions then travel on waves of gas – like spitting peas into the wind! When these little ions (or peas) come near the Earth and our magnetic field, they start to jiggle and shake and glow – causing a glowing light show in the sky!  Pretty neat, huh?  And these lights can happen all year long in some places.  In other places, like Alaska, where they get daylight for 24 hours a day during the summer, it can be hard to see the lights.  I have never seen these lights before, but maybe one of our listeners has.  I would love to hear from you and learn what you think about them!

The Grand Canyon
The Second wonder of the natural world is the Grand Canyon in the state of Arizona in the United States.  You have probably seen pictures of it!  It looks like huge, rust-colored mountains with their tops cut off.  Everything is flat on top, but the mountains go down deep into a canyon, so deep it is hard to see the bottom! To me, it looks like a giant rock maze from above.  The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, 18 miles wide, and over a mile deep! That’s a long way down.  Scientists estimate that it is about 5-6 million years old and was carved by the Colorado River running through it.  Millions and millions of years of flowing water washed away pieces of the rock and cut pathways through the Canyon.  During the ice age, there was a lot of rain in this area and the water rushed through the canyon even quicker, cutting away larger pieces of rock and carving caves.  

Through the ages, Native American tribes have made the Grand Canyon their home.  Some still live there today.  These days you can go white water rafting through the canyon, ride a helicopter above it, ride a mule into it, or hike around it.  Just be sure to bring plenty of water and warm clothes if you plan to go to the bottom!  It’s a long hike down and the temperature can change drastically between the top and the bottom where there is less sun.  


The Great Barrier Reef
The third natural wonder is the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, Australia.  It is the world’s largest coral reef stretching over 133,000 miles.  It is home to 900 islands and three thousand different reefs.  It is also home to over 1,500 fish species, 215 bird species, and 134 shark species!  I know I’d much rather meet a clownfish there than a great white shark!  The reef is over 200 feet deep and can even be seen from outer space!  It was created by billions of tiny little coral polyps and is the largest structure in the world built by living organisms.  Think of billions of little minions under the sea making coral apartment buildings!  The Great Barrier Reef is world famous and many people travel to see it.  Unfortunately, it is struggling to survive.  It has lost more than half of its coral since 1985 due to climate change.  The sun heats the water and bleaches the coral, killing it.  It’s like boiling a lobster in hot water.  Also, damage from human dumping and attacks by the Crown-of-Thorns Starfish have also damaged the reef.  The good news is that a certain type of coral, called Acropora coral, is growing quickly on the reef and has regrown large portions of it.  Coral can grow up to 9 inches in height and one inch in width a year – that’s more than you and me! It needs to live at a maximum depth of 490 feet because it needs to be close to the surface – and sunlight- to grow.  It cannot grow above the water line.  I think it would be incredible to take a boat around the Great Barrier Reef or go scuba diving there one day.  What do you think?

Mount Everest
Number four on our list is Mount Everest, which is so big it sits in China and Nepal!  Mount Everest is over 29,000 feet tall, meaning it is as high as the cruising altitude of airplanes.  That’s a LONG way up!  It has other names given to it by the Chinese and Indians, including Sagarmatha and Chomolungma, meaning “Holy Mother.”  It is called “Holy Mother” because it is the largest mountain in the Himalayan Mountain Range – and the world!  Most of the world knows the mountain by the name Mount Everest.  It was named after an early British Surveyor named Sir George Everest, who was surveying – or measuring – mountains in the Himalayans in the 1800s.  He didn’t want the mountain named after him because the native Chinese and Indian people couldn’t write or say the name Everest, but it was done anyway.   Mount Everest is very dangerous – it has deep crevasses or canyons – plus the Khumbu Ice Fall, an area at the base of the mountain filled with large ice blocks that fall over a lot.  It also has a lot of avalanches, which are roaring blasts of falling snow.  At the top, it gets very windy and there is very little oxygen.  Nothing can live at that height, not even birds.  To climb Mount Everest, you need to be in top physical shape, have a lot of climbing equipment, and carry bottles of oxygen to use at the top – similar to what scuba divers do when they go to the bottom of the sea.  Most climbers climb Mount Everest with the assistance of Sherpas – or native Tibetan guides – who carry large loads of equipment up and down the mountain and set ropes for the climbers.  

There is a big mystery on Mount Everest, too.  In 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine from England tried to be the first climbers to summit the mountain.  They were last seen near the top, but then disappeared in the fog.  They were never seen again.  To this day we do not know if they reached the top.  But in 1953, Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary reached the top of Mount Everest and made it back down safely, becoming the first documented climbers to reach the top of the world!  That is truly incredible! 

Paricutin Volcano
Moving on to number five on our list is Paricutin, a volcano in Michoacan, Mexico. It was formed in 1948 after erupting out of a farmer’s cornfield.  You may think, “There are lots of volcanos around the world.  What makes this one so special?”  Well, this was the first volcano that modern scientists could track and study from its start! Most of the volcanos on Earth are under the sea or erupted thousands – or even millions – of years ago.  This volcano erupted fairly recently and continued to grow and spit out lava for 9 years, reaching a height of 1,391 feet and destroying 90 square miles with lava, stone, and ash. Hundreds of people evacuated, two towns were completely buried and three other towns were damaged, but luckily only 3 people were killed.  This volcano sits on the Trans-Mexican belt, a trail of old volcanos running west to east across Mexico.  Today, the crater measures approximately 660 feet across and people can walk around the rim and climb up and down its sides.  Although it is said to be extinct now, or dead, it is still hot and when rainwater hits it, it spews steam into the air.  In 1997, the area experienced 230 earthquakes in quick succession.  In 2006, over 300 more earthquakes rumbled near the volcano.  This does not sound like it is extinct to me.  I think I’ll leave the volcano climbing to others!  I’m not wild about being covered in burning lava, are you?  

Rio Harbour
Number six on our list is Rio Harbour in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is also called Guanabara Bay, which means “Arm of the Sea” and it is the world’s largest bay.  It is over 19 miles long and boasts 130 islands.  Explorer Charles Darwin stated, “It seemed almost unreal” for its natural beauty and stellar surroundings: glistening beaches, granite monoliths, and majestic mountains.  Also visible from this bay is the “Christ the Redeemer” statue on Corcovado Mountain. This statute is on another famous list: the 7 Wonders of the World, meaning things made by man.  Brazil is very lucky to have two wonders in its own backyard!

Victoria Falls
And the 7th natural wonder of the world is Victoria Falls, located between Zambia and Zimbabwe in Southern Africa.  In its native languages, its name means “The Smoke that Thunders,” “Boiling Water,” or “The Place of the Rainbow.”  The falls are so big and so vast that the water roaring over them sounds like thunder and throws billowing clouds of mist into the air – and even makes rainbows.  It is one of the largest waterfalls on Earth and measures over 5,604 feet across, and 354 feet tall, and the spray can rise 1,300 feet or more.  The spray can even be seen from 30 miles away.  So why is it named Victoria Falls?  Well, a Scottish missionary and explorer named David Livingstone came across it in 1855 and named it after England’s Queen Victoria.  Just like with Mount Everest, early explorers found amazing places and renamed them, instead of keeping their native names.  

And where does all the water go after it tumbles over the falls?  It tumbles through a series of gorges making various turns and zig-zags while tumbling downstream.  At the second gorge, there is a deep pool of water called the Boiling Pot.  It measures 500 feet across and at times has enormous swirls and a boiling surface like a witch’s cauldron.  Crocodiles, humans, and even hippopotami have been found in these swirling waters or along the Pot’s nearby shores.  My advice to you: stay well away from the edge of the falls!  You don’t want to go over the brink with a Hippo!

Aren’t these seven natural wonders of the world amazing?  Have you seen any of them yet?  Which ones would you like to see?  Maybe you can make a list and plan trips with your family – or visit them when you grow up.  I sure would like to see some of these amazing sites.  I’ve seen The Grand Canyon but I sure would like to see more – and take my family with me.  

Maybe as a fun project, you can make a rhyme about these wonders to remember them.  If you do, I’d like to hear your rhyme.  Feel free to send it to me using the link in the show notes.  Your name and rhyme might be mentioned in a future episode!

Story:
Today, we are going to hear the tale of an amazing animal – a feisty Pointer dog nicknamed “Gunboat Judy.”  Judy lived during a terrible time in history, World War II, and her story is one of courage, survival, and loyalty.  Judy came from humble beginnings.  She was born in a kennel in Shanghai but rose to fame as a war hero, diplomat, and celebrity.  And like our previous stories on “Unsinkable Sam, the Battleship Cat” and “Jeep, the Flying Coyote,” the story of Gunboat Judy is truly amazing and inspirational.  So, let’s dive right in!

Judy, who was originally called “Shudi,” was born in February 1937 in a kennel in Shanghai, one of 7 adorable puppies.  That August, sailors from a British gunboat, HMS Gnat, visited the kennel looking for a dog.  They bought Judy and returned with her to the ship.  Judy didn’t know it at the time, but her life was going to change forever.

Like every puppy, Judy was inquisitive, rambunctious, and full of energy.  One day she became a little too excited and fell overboard into the Yangtze River.  The captain immediately stopped the ship and sent a small boat out to rescue Judy.   She must have felt very scared but she paddled bravely with her little paws until help arrived. Upon her safe return to the ship, the incident was noted in the captain’s log as a “man overboard exercise!”


Judy
The days ticked by and Judy grew accustomed to ship life and all the friendly sailors.  Then one night, Judy heard something strange.  The sailors were asleep and didn’t notice that a boat was drifting silently towards them in the water.  Judy heard it though, and didn’t like it.  She started growling, then barking.  Her barks awakened the sailors and alerted them to the dangerous pirates nearby.  Due to Judy’s actions, the pirates retreated and the seamen were saved.

Judy quickly became invaluable as a protector.  She would bark when she heard the approach of Japanese planes long before the crew heard them in the skies.  One day, a sailor took Judy for a walk outside a nearby city and Judy started running away, dragging the man behind her.  This action shocked the sailor and as he turned around, he saw a leopard behind them!  Luckily, they both escaped with their lives that day!

In November, the seamen took Judy to a party on a US ship, the USS Panay.  After the party, the British sailors returned to their boat, only to discover that Judy was missing.  They contacted the Panay but was told Judy was not there.  Eventually they learned that Judy had been kidnapped by the US sailors as a prank.  The British sailors were not amused.  They sailed back to the Panay, snuck onto the ship, and stole their brass bell.  They later contacted the Panay with one demand: “Give us our dog and we’ll give you your bell.”  Judy was returned within the hour!


The following year, Judy met another Pointer on a French gunboat and the crew decided that the two dogs should get married!  They held a wedding ceremony and later that same year, Judy had a litter of Pointer puppies!  The puppies were later gifted to French and American boat crews.

But war was approaching.  In September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany and Judy’s ship sailed to Singapore.  Two years later, they fought in the Battle of Singapore providing anti-aircraft fire and evacuating people from the island.  Poor Judy must have been frightened by all the Japanese airplanes diving at their ship and the gunship firing back at them.

A month later, on Valentine’s Day 1942, Judy alerted the crew that Japanese planes were approaching.  The sailors raced to their guns as the planes dove out of the sky, their engines shrieking as they dropped three bombs on the ship.  The captain ordered an immediate evacuation.  The sailors jumped into boats and paddled to a deserted island while Japanese planes shot at them from above.  Only when they arrived on shore did they notice that Judy was not among them.  One sailor rowed back to the flaming ship to find Judy and retrieve supplies.  He grabbed Judy, where she was trapped under some metal lockers, and rowed back to the island.  That night, the ship exploded and sunk out of sight.  Judy had been rescued just in time!

The crew quickly discovered that the island had minimal food and no fresh water.  But Judy saved the day again by digging and finding a fresh water spring!  At night, she stood watch over the sleeping soldiers, keeping deadly snakes at bay.  

Five days later, the sailors were rescued by a passing tongkang – a small supply boat – and they set sail in search of the British Navy.  They even trekked 200 miles across Sumatra.  Poor Judy.  She must have been tired and thirsty and hot, but she continued to protect her friends.  One day while they were trekking through the jungle, Judy was attacked by a crocodile.  She suffered an injury to her shoulder, which a sailor bandaged as best he could.  A short time later, Judy started barking furiously and saved the sailors from an attack by a Sumatran tiger!  She never let down her guard while in that hot, scary jungle, always alert for snakes, tigers, and other large predators.  Eventually they were caught by the Japanese and taken to a camp as prisoners of war.  The sailors hid Judy under empty rice sacks so the Japanese soldiers wouldn’t kill her.

Once in camp, Judy met Leading Aircraftman Frank Williams and they became quick friends.  Frank would save rice from his meager meals to share with Judy.  In return, Judy would bark at the Japanese guards to distract them from beating the prisoners.  This angered the guards, who aimed their guns at Judy.  Williams ran forward and intervened just in time.  He pleaded with the camp commandant to save Judy and make her an official prisoner of war.  In return, Williams would give the commandant one of her future puppies.  The commander agreed and Judy became the only animal prisoner of war and was registered as prisoner “81A.”

Judy was more than a protector in camp.  She also foraged in the nearby forest, bringing back rats and snakes for the prisoners to eat.  She had another litter of puppies and one was given to the camp commandant as promised, while another was smuggled into the women’s camp along with precious morsels of food.

In June 1944, the prisoners were transferred to Singapore aboard a Japanese ship.  Judy was stuffed into an empty rice sack and slung over Williams shoulders.  He had to hide her from the Japanese because dogs were not allowed on board and they might kill her.  It was blazing hot and the prisoners stood on the metal deck for 3 hours but Judy didn’t make a peep inside the sack.  

Three weeks later, the British torpedoed the Japanese ship and chaos ensued.  Fire, flames and screams filled the air.  Frightened men scrambled up and out of the sinking ship.  Williams grabbed Judy and pushed her out of a porthole to the water 15 feet below.  Then he lost sight of her.  He raced to the deck and jumped into the water, swimming for land.  Of the 700 prisoners on board the ship, 500 did not survive.

But Williams did survive.  He was recaptured and sent to another prison camp.  When he arrived, he heard stories of a dog who saved drowning sailors by dragging them to floating debris or brought debris to them to keep them float.  As fate would have it, Judy was plucked out of the water by other British sailors, who hid her from the Japanese prison guards.  About 4 weeks later, Judy and Williams were happily reunited in the camp!  

For the next year the prisoners worked building railroad tracks in the jungles of Sumatra.  Judy stood guard over them, barking at any large beasts that came near, such as tigers and elephants.  And her personality was changing in the prison camp.  Stated Williams, “She wasn’t that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct.”  Judy became more aggressive towards the Japanese and Korean guards.  Williams would send her into the jungle to keep her out of sight, but one day a guard shot at her. The bullet grazed her shoulder.  Williams could do nothing but bandage the wound with a palm frond.  

When a lice infestation broke out in the camp, the guards were ordered to kill Judy.  Before they could do so, Williams sent her back into the woods, where she hid until the guards evacuated the camp several days later.  

The war was finally over!  The prisoners were rescued by allied troops and put on ships for home.  Again, Judy was smuggled on board and kept out of sight.

Upon landing in England, Williams and Judy became instant celebrities.  Judy was awarded the Dickin Medal – a WWII medal honoring animals – and a medal for valor.  She appeared with Williams on a BBC radio broadcast and at a victory celebration at Wembley Stadium in front of 82,000 people.  Newspapers hailed her as “Gunboat Judy.”  

Judy and Williams spent a year traveling England visiting the families of POWs and raising money for charities. In 1948, Williams accepted a job in East Africa and took Judy with him.  They stayed for two years and Judy had her third litter of puppies.  Then it was discovered that Judy had a tumor.  She underwent surgery but contracted an infection and passed away at the age of 14.  She was buried in an RAF flight jacket with her three combat medals.  Williams spent two months building a monument in her honor before leaving South Africa.

Judy’s legacy lives on.  She was featured in the children’s book, “The Judy Story” and on the British TV show, “Blue Peter.”  Her collar and Dickin Medal were put on display at the Imperial War Museum in London.  This medal reads: “For magnificent courage and endurance in Japanese prison camps, which helped to maintain morale among her fellow prisoners, and also for saving many lives through her intelligence and watchfulness.”

I think this is an incredible story of the special bond between humans and dogs.  Judy was shot, torpedoed, attacked by a crocodile, starved, kidnapped, and smuggled around Asia.  And yet she remained loyal to her friends and protected them fiercely from pirates, predators, and prison guards.  She’s a true inspiration, showing us that dogs can survive under the most extreme circumstances with intelligence, strength, and courage.  

Story:
The Caribbean is made up of three main island chains. They are called the Lesser and Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. The Lesser Antilles includes a chain of islands that start at Trinidad in the south and end at the three U.S. Virgin Islands in the north. The Greater Antilles is made up of Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. The Bahamas are north of Hispaniola and Cuba. 

The first group of people believed to live in the Caribbean islands was the Ciboneys, who came there nearly 4 or 5 thousand years ago. 

Later, the Tainos and the Caribs were two groups of people who lived on the islands. They had come from the Americas thousands of years before. The Caribs were a warrior tribe and wore their hair black and long. They dressed in feathers and necklaces made of their victim’s teeth and painted their bodies red. They fished and hunted to eat and lived in thatched shelters. At one point the Caribs began forcing the Tainos off of the islands.

The Carib people were generally more peaceful and were farmers who cultivated “yucca” and sweet potatoes. They were also excellent hunters using bows and arrows to shoot their prey. 

The Caribbean was discovered by Europeans when Christopher Columbus was in 1492 in search of a new trade route to the east. He landed in the Bahamas and named the island San Salvador. He thought he had found the spice islands of the West Indies and because of his mistake Spain named them as such and they have the same name today. 

When Christopher Columbus landed in the Bahamas the people living there, also called indigenous peoples, he called “Indians.” They were made up of the Caribs and the Tainos (or Arawaks). Queen Isabella of Spain did not allow the enslavement of these some of these people, but it happened anyway. 

The first settlement by Spain was in Hispaniola in 1493. Their main interest in the islands was gold and mining other precious metals, and here the Spanish built fortresses to protect what they considered to be their property. For this reason, other European countries were not able to settle in these areas, but instead took some of the settlements where the Spanish weren’t as strong. For example, the British colonized Barbados and the French took Martinique and Guadeloupe, and the Dutch controlled Aruban, St. Maarten, and a few other islands in the 1600s. Sadly, most of the native people living on these islands were forced into slavery to work for the settlers and eventually died off because of diseases and how they were treated.

Soon it was found that the Caribbean islands were perfect for farming sugar, so sugar plantations began to be very popular. But because the native people had died off, there were no longer slaves to farm the land. For this reason, slavers moved to Africa and started kidnapping the people there and forcing them into slavery in the Caribbean. Over 10 million African slaves were taken by boat to the Caribbean to be slaves on the sugar plantations! They were packed so tightly into the ships often 12 percent of them died along the way. Once arriving on the islands they were auctioned off and traded. Because of how cruelly they were treated, many of these slaves escaped or led revolts and started their own communities away from the plantations. To this day many of the people living on the islands are descendants of these slaves. In the 1800s slavery was also outlawed by the British and eventually the French and Dutch and Spanish. The cost of producing sugar also grew, so there was a decline in production at this time.

In 1789 slaves led by Toussaint Louverture revolted and took control of their own country of Haiti which later became independent of France in 1804. After Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Cuba also became independent along with Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. 

The Caribbean is also known for its history of pirates. In the early 1600s pirates made their homes on many of the islands. Many of them raised cattle and traded them, which is where the name “buccaneers” comes from because they cured the meat in ovens called “boucans.” They lived in small clans and were made up of many different backgrounds. Many found their home base in Tortuga, off the coast of Haiti. From here they ventured out and attacked ships to steal their goods. 

Today, the Caribbean is more civilized and has become a tourist destination for people all over the world. It has large hotels and caters to visitors who want to come to spend time on the beaches, enjoy the warm, crystal blue water, and do other water activities such as snorkeling and scuba diving. The Caribbean is also known as a prime destination for cruise ships that are constantly docking to unload tourists to enjoy the beautiful tropical weather and scenery of the islands.

Imagine you are walking along a trail in the desert…
You have been walking for many days and are now holding your mother’s hand. Your dog is trotting along beside you. You are of the Pueblo tribe and every year visit a place that is holy to your people. You have been counting down the days and now the steps and the day has finally come. The air is cool this time of year and the sky is clear and blue as far as you can see. Your father and brother are walking ahead with the others and someone calls out “Kaibab! Kaibab!” You leave your mother’s hand and rush ahead with them, faster and faster, trying to beat your brother to the sight. And then suddenly you stop and gasp! Spread out for miles ahead of you is the beauty of what you call Kaibab, the widest and most beautiful of canyons in the world. You hold your breath and slowly take in the wonder of this place that is holy to you and your people. 

Width, Length, and Depth of the Grand Canyon
The Grand Canyon is the widest canyon in the world and is located in Arizona, which also happens to be my home state. It is also considered one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide, and over 6,000 feet deep in places. It is very colorful, a combination of reds, browns, whites, and many other colors, because each of the different layers, or strata, was formed at different times during the Earth’s history. The Earth is very, very old, so the Grand Canyon is made up of different rocks from its 2 billion-year-old history.

Formation of the Grand Canyon
Early on the Grand Canyon was actually a mountain, which over time sunk down until it was flat. Then as the earth shifted it became a canyon and over a very long period was even underwater. Eventually, a river started flowing through the canyon, which is now known as The Colorado River. The water in the river was full of rocks, so over millions of years, the river acted like sandpaper shaving down the canyon. This is called erosion. Today when you look at the Grand Canyon you can see the different layers in it, similar to a layered cake. Some of the layers are white limestone, other layers are filled with shells from when it was underwater, and the upper layers are darker and were formed by a volcano. 

Ancestral Puebloans
After The Grand Canyon was formed into what it looks like today, around 3000 years ago, native people who we now called the Ancestral Puebloans lived near the Grand Canyon. They build homes out of stone and farmed corn, squash, and beans. They made carvings and paintings on canyon walls, which is one way we know they lived there. Another group who lived there was called the Cohonina, who are the ancestors of the modern Yuma, Havasupai, and Hualapai people, who still live around the Grand Canyon. The native people call The Grand Canyon Kaibab, which means “mountain on its side.” The ancient people believed The Grand Canyon was a holy place and often visited from miles around to experience its wonder.

European Discovery of the Grand Canyon
After Europeans discovered The New World, Francisco Vazquez de Coronado and a group of Spanish explorers were in the area searching for the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola. In 1540 Coronado ordered Captain Garcia Lopez de Cardenas and his soldiers to explore the area. They and their Hopi native guides were the first Europeans to see the wonders of The Grand Canyon. They were amazed at its size and vastness. Two hundred years passed until another European visited the canyon.

In 1776 two Spanish Priests, Francisco Dominguez and Silvestre de Escalante explored southern Utah and the north rim of the Grand Canyon. 

In the 1850s they were followed by Jacob Hamblin, a Mormon explorer sent by Brigham Young to find a way to cross the river. They made friends with the Hualapai tribe and found the crossing discovered by the Spanish Priests, which later became Lees Ferry. A ferry is a place where a flat boat helps wagons and people cross a river. 

John Wesley Powell
Then in 1869, Major John Wesley Powell led the first expedition down into the canyon. He had set out to explore the Colorado River and The Grand Canyon. They rode down the river on a boat and survived the dangerous rapids and finally ended up in what is now known as Moab, Utah. John Wesley Powell later became famous for the founding of the Boy Scouts of America. 

National Park
In 1903 President Theodore Roosevelt visited The Grand Canyon and marveled at its beauty. Teddy Roosevelt was known for his love of nature and spent much of his time outdoors. In awe at the Grand Canyon, he did everything he could to help preserve its natural wonder. They worked to make it a national monument and believed places like The Grand Canyon should be preserved so people all over the world could enjoy it. While Roosevelt was president he formed the National Parks Association to help save places like The Grand Canyon. 

Tourism
Today The Grand Canyon is one of the most famous places to visit in the world with about five million visitors every year who come from all over to see and explore it. Most people just come to look out over the vast canyon. I’ve been there a few times with my family, it’s about a 4-hour drive for us from where we live near Phoenix, Arizona. The last time I went we brought our 4 young kids, who also looked out over it in awe. We had to hold them close to us because the canyon is a very steep drop below, which made us pretty nervous.

Havasupai
When I was in high school our family and a group of other families hiked down into a part of the Grand Canyon known as Havasupai. We drove there early in the morning and had all of our camping gear and food loaded onto the back of mules, then we hiked about 4 hours down into the canyon. At the bottom of the trail are huge, picturesque Havasu Falls. You can swim at the bottom of the falls, jump off cliffs and hike further in to see and swim in the other waterfalls. Our trip was very fun but took a turn for the worse when one of the days I slipped on a rock and twisted my ankle pretty badly. The next day we were supposed to hike out, so my close friend and I got up early and started hiking out. I limped most of the way, even up the steep switchbacks. It was a rough hike out, but the waterfalls and swimming holes made it worth it anyway. 

In addition to hiking, people take helicopter tours over The Grand Canyon and love to raft the wild Colorado River. People also take horseback tours down into the canyon and it’s very popular to hike it from rim to rim — my sisters and their friends did this recently. Another main attraction is the Grand Canyon Skywalk, which lets you walk on a glass-bottomed path out over the canyon, so you can look at the drop far below.

Conclusion
Do you have any natural wonders near you? It may be mountains, a beautiful river, or the ocean. Spending time in nature is good for you. It helps relax your mind and body. I know I always feel better when I spend time outside or on a hike. Just this last week my kids and I spent some time hiking and visiting a stream nearby. Spend time thinking about what places in nature near you you can visit. And if you’re ever in Arizona, definitely be sure to visit the amazing Grand Canyon! 

Story:
Imagine you are walking through the forest…
Imagine you are walking along a path in the forest.  Around you are beautiful mountains covered with lush green trees.  You see tall bamboo trees and birds in the sky. Nearby is a small mountain village where families are cooking dinner and playing in common areas.  As you walk further along the path toward the mountain range, you suddenly look up and see a gigantic stone wall cutting through the forest. You place your hands on it and look up. It is incredibly high. When you look left and right you see that it stretches in both directions as far as your eye can see.  You are at one of the most famous structures in the world: the Great Wall of China! 

The Great Wall of China was built over 2,000 years ago and runs more than 13,000 miles across northern China.  But why was this wall built?  And how has it lasted so long?


Emperor Chin Shi Huang
The Great Wall of China was constructed by Emperor Chin Shi Huang in the 3rd century B.C.  Well actually, parts of the wall were built earlier than that and it is doubtful that Emperor Chin did any of the actual construction work himself.  

Emperor Chin united a number of different independent states in China and was the first emperor to unite all of these different communities together as one Chinese country.  This happened around 220 B.C.  Before that, there were many different kingdoms throughout China and different groups of people living on their own.  The land that the Chinese people lived on was very fertile. Fertile means the land is good for growing lots of food. Over time, the people that lived in the area started to farm and grow crops.  As more people farmed the land, they needed to create systems of order and government to help manage the land and how it was used.  

Warring States Period
At this time, Chinese people developed and irrigated fields and grew crops near the Yellow River valley. Farming large areas of land required people to work together and form a government to work the land peacefully.  That is why the Chinese formed one empire and also built walls around them to protect their communities against attacks by the nomads.  Nomads mean someone who doesn’t live in one place but moves from place to place. The nomads didn’t farm, but instead moved around and herded animals. They used the food from these animals to survive. They also hunted instead of staying in one place and farming. 

Since the nomads needed to move with the animals, they had a completely different type of society and order. They needed to hunt animals or trade for them.  This led to the nomads trading with the Chinese or in many cases attacking them.

The Great Wall of China
The nomadic tribes often came into contact with the Chinese farmers.  Sometimes it was friendly and they would trade with each other.  But often, they did not get along.  The nomadic people wanted to use the farmland to hunt and move around, but the farm people wanted more land to farm. This led to battles between the farmers and the nomads.  The farming kingdoms also often fought each other for control of different territories. This is why this period of history in China is known as the “Warring States Period.”

To help avoid attacks, many of the kingdoms built walls to defend themselves.  The walls were made out of rocks and compacted dirt that was tamped very tightly to form the structure.  These walls were shorter versions of the Great Wall of China that were later built.  They stretched between the border of different regions and often included towers, block houses for soldiers, and beacons to send smoke signals.

When Emperor Chin became emperor, he wanted to put a stop to the fighting between different farming kingdoms.  He declared that all of these kingdoms were now part of one country called China.  But the nomadic people that lived outside the area didn’t care about this.  They continued to attack the farming areas. 

Imperial Order
To help stop these attacks and to continue to unite the new country, the Emperor ordered that the walls between different states be removed and that the shorter walls that existed along the northern border of China be joined together to form one long wall.  Emperor Qin thought that this would also help protect them against attacks from the north where China’s biggest enemy lived — Mongolia. The Mongolians were fierce fighters and very dangerous to the Chinese.

Construction
The project of building the Great Wall was a huge task requiring a lot of work.  Emperor Qin ordered his army to work on the wall, so much of it was constructed by soldiers.  But they needed even more workers to get the job done.  So Emperor Qin ordered that prisoners work on the wall as well.  This is called “forced labor,” which is when someone is forced to do a job without getting paid. It was hard work and estimated that around 400,000 workers died while building the wall.  

Conditions were probably very difficult due to the long stretches of mountains and desert where the Wall was built.  Today, there are some areas of the Great Wall where no one lives because the conditions are so difficult and there are some parts where the winters are so cold that no one goes there in the winter.  Can you imagine having to work on building a large wall in those conditions?

Manual Labor
Because much of the wall is built with rammed earth, most of the materials that they used to build the wall could be found right where they were building it.  However, some additional supplies and workers had to travel a far way to get to the wall. This made construction even more difficult. Sometimes the young men that were forced to build the wall had to haul boats loaded with baggage upstream in rivers in order to bring food to the workers.  The work was so hard that many people tried to escape and sneak away back to the city or to their hometowns.  Many individuals died in the wilderness trying to escape because the conditions were hard to survive and the journey home was so long. 

Eventually, people living in the newly united China started to revolt against the Qin dynasty.  To revolt means to fight against and overthrow.  Emperor Qin was a strict ruler and not everyone agreed with his rules. As Emperor Qin lost the support of the Chinese people over time, there were fewer and fewer soldiers that were willing to go out to work on the wall.  They stopped listening to his orders and as a result, the construction of the wall slowed down. 

Construction Continues
Later Chinese rulers carried on the construction and eventually the wall was finished.  This included the Han, Sui, Northern, Jin, and Ming Dynasties.  Each repaired, rebuilt or expanded the wall.  During the Ming Dynasty, major rebuilding work took place and sections of the wall that were originally built with dirt were replaced with bricks and stone instead.  These new materials helped the wall to last longer in good shape. 

One of the first mentions of a wall built against northern invaders is found in a poem, dated the seventh century BC.  It is recorded in the ancient Chinese book of Classic Poetry. 

In 221 BC, when Qin Shi Huang united the Chinese states, the walls were known as “Changcheng” which literally means “long walls”.  The walls were mostly constructed of tamped earth, which some parts built with stones. Where natural barriers, like ravines and rivers, worked enough for defense, the walls were erected sparingly.  Often in addition to the wall, defensive systems like garrisons and beacon towers were built inside the wall, and watchtowers were on the outside at regular intervals. 

Unfortunately the Great Wall never totally prevented invaders from coming into China.  It was a useful way to stop raids.  But at several points throughout its history, the Great Wall failed to stop enemies.  This included in 1644 when the Manchu Qing marched through the gates of Shanhai Pass and replaced the Ming dynasty as the new rulers of China.  But the Great Wall came to be seen as a symbol of the ongoing power and strength of the Chinese civilization. 

Genghis Khan
Eventually, the Chinese were forced to move back from the northern part of China when the Mongolian people attacked the north and conquered and took control of China.  The Mongols were led by Genghis Khan, a famous, violent leader. The Mongols didn’t need the Great Wall as much as the Chinese had in the past, but they assigned soldiers to man the wall in order to protect merchants and travelers traveling along the Silk Road trade routes. 

Eventually, the Ming Dynasty took control of the area again.  During the Ming Dynasty, the Ming rules were very strong leaders, and Chinese culture grew stronger. They built a lot of additional parts of the Great Wall including bridges, temples, and pagodas.  Pagodas are like western gazebos or covered areas that people can sit under.

Conclusion
Between the 18th and 20th centuries, the Great Wall became the most common symbol of China for the Western world. Today, the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive building feats in human history. In 1987, UNESCO, an international heritage organization, designated the Great Wall a World Heritage site.  At the time, it was the only man-made structure that could be visible from space!

In modern times, thousands of tourists visit the Great Wall of China.  The most popular part of the wall and the most famous is called Badaling.  It runs 43 miles northwest of Beijing.  Would you like to see the Great Wall of China one day?  If you do, think of all of the people that worked to build and maintain the wall throughout time.  Walking along the Great Wall of China, you will surely be walking along part of history!

Stories:
Take a minute to imagine that you have traveled with your family to Italy.  You visit a popular tourist spot to check out one of the most famous buildings in the world: the leaning Tower of Pisa.  As you approach the tower, you can see that it is leaning over at a strange tilt.  How is this tower even standing?  It has white pillars and arches.  It leans at an angle that is scary, but you can see that it is held up by large metal wires pulling against its weight.  Your family decides that they are going to go inside to explore. It sounds a little risky to go inside a leaning tower.  Will you go inside too?

The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most famous buildings in the world.  It is a freestanding bell tower in the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa.  A cathedral means a church that has a section where a religious leader, a bishop, lives inside.  The tower is known around the world for its strong lean.  The tower leans at an angle of four-degrees.  The lean is due to a foundation that is not stable.  This means that the base of the tower that holds the tower up is likely to fall.

The Tower of Pisa is 183 feet from the ground on the low side and 186 feet on the high side.  It has 295 steps to the top level. 

The Tower first began to lean during the time it was built in the 12th century.  This happened because the ground that the Tower was built on was soft and could not properly support the weight of the huge tower. Throughout the building of the tower, the leaning only got worse. Oops! And it continued to lean more over the next few hundred years. By 1990, the tilt had reached 5 ½ degrees!  This was so far over that the Italian government decided to add extra support beams to help stabilize the tower.  Their work was successful and after 8 years of extra work the tilt of the building was reduced to 4 degrees. 

There is some mystery around who designed the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  For many years, people thought that the architect was a man named Bonanno Pisano.  This was based on a piece of metal found in the earth at the base of the tower.  But later scientists concluded that a different man named Diotisalvi was that actual architect and that Pisano likely just made the door frame.  This was due to the fact that the tower is very similar to at least two other buildings that Diotisalvi designed in Pisa. 

The Tower of Pisa was built in three stages over almost 200 years. In the year 1172, a woman named Donna Berta di Bernardo inherited a large sum of money from her husband.  She gave some of this money to the local Opera house in Pisa and she used the rest towards buying a few stones that are still part of the base of the bell tower.

One year later, the government had enough money to hire a crew of workers to continue to build the tower.  The government had more money than in recent years due to the fact that the army had successfully taken over some additional areas.  The crews started by building the foundations of the tower.  Later that year, they laid the ground floor of the tower with white marble. This ground floor has a “blind arcade”.  This means that the bottom had columns with classical looking arches but the other side of the arches have no actual openings.  Instead, it is just a hard surface of a wall with arches that are decorative, or there to make it look nice.  

The arches also aren’t “load-bearing”.  This means that they do not support the weight of the structure. 

About 400 years later, a man named Giorgio Vasari wrote that Guglielma together with sculptor Bonanno laid the foundation, or base, of the bell tower in the tower of Pisa.

The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. The reason was because the foundation was not built to be high enough.  It was only three-metres high, which was very low for a tower of that height.  

Unfortunately, the tower was set in weak, unstable soil or dirt.  This was a problem that was there right from the beginning. Because the tower started to sink, the people who were building the tower stopped construction.  The tower then sat there for almost 100 years with nothing being done.  The country that the tower was in was called the Republic of Pisa. The Republic was almost constantly battling with the neighbouring countries of Genoa, Lucca and Florence. 

The 100 years that the tower sat there was actually a good thing.  This allowed time for the soil underneath the tower to settle, or become more stable. If the original construction crew had carried on building the tower, the tower would have almost definitely fallen over.

In the year 1233, a father and son started to do further construction work on the tower to try to finish it.  They eventually had to pass the project on to another builder and then yet another took over.  

In 1264, the tower construction had finally moved along far enough that the main architect at the time, hired 23 workers to go into the mountains close to Pisa and cut marble. After the marble was cut out of the mountain, they used it on the tower. In order to compensate, or counter-balance, for the tilt, the designers build the upper floors of the tower with one side taller than the other.  For this reason, the tower is actually curved today.  

The seventh floor was finished in 1319 and then the bell-chamber was finally added in the year 1372.  The bell-chamber, or room holding the bell, was built by a man named Tommaso di Andrea Pisano. He used Gothic elements and a Romanesque style of the tower. These are different historic styles of buildings that were popular at different times in Europe’s history. There are seven bells in the bell-chamber, one for each note of the musical major scale.  

After the tower of Pisa was finished, the tower was admired by many people and has had some famous visitors.  A famous astronomer _______ dropped cannonballs off of the tower to show the law of free fall, a famous law in physics.  Physics is the study of matter and motion, or things and movement. 

During World War 2, the Allies, Americans and English, thought that the Germans were using the tower of Pisa as a watch post. A U.S. Army sergeant was sent to find out if German troops were in the tower.  He was so impressed by the beauty of the tower, that even though he found that there were Germans in there he held back on ordering an air attack to save the tower from being destroyed.

There have been many attempts to restore the tower to a straight, standing, position or at least keep it from falling over. Unfortunately, most of these efforts failed.  And some of these attempts even made the tower worse.  

In 1964, the Italian government raised money to restore the tower again and stop it from falling over.  The government wanted it to become more stable, but it still wanted the tower to have a tilt. They realized that the tilt was what made it famous! It helped attract tourists, or visitors from other places, to visit Pisa, so why fix it?

The Tower was closed to visitors in January 1990 due to the collapse of another tower nearby.  The collapse scared the Italian government that the same things might happen to the tower of Pisa.  They removed the bells to take some of the weight out of the towers.  They also cinched cables around the third level of the tower and anchored the cables hundreds of metres away. People who lived in home nearby were told to leave to make sure they wouldn’t be hurt if the tower fell over. 

In 1993, the Italian government added almost 900 tonnes of lead counterweights, or weights on the other side of the tower to counter-balance the weight of the leaning side.  This helped straighten the tower a bit. They also removed soil underneath the raised side of the tower to help prevent the collapse of the tower. This helped to make the tilt of the tower a safer angle. This method worked!   The tower’s tilt was reduced by almost 18 inches, returning to its 1838 position. 

Finally, after 10 years of work to rebuild the tower and make it more stable, the tower was re-opened to the public in December 2001.  The government declared that it was now stable for at least another 200 years.  

Would you like to visit the leaning tower of Pisa one day?  If you do visit, would you brave enough to go inside?

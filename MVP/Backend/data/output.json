    "content": "Fossil remains of these ancient creatures, called Timorebestia, were discovered on the island of Greenland, located in the North Atlantic Ocean. It's thought the sea worms dominated the oceans more than 500 million years ago. Growing to around 30cm in length, the Timorebestia had a distinct head with long antennae and massive jaw structures inside its mouth, as well as fins on the sides of its body. Researchers from the University of Bristol discovered fossils of the previously unknown species during expeditions in North Greenland. The new ancient worms have been named Timorebestia, meaning 'terror beasts' in Latin. Dr Jakob Vinther from the University of Bristol, who was involved with the study explained: \"Timorebestia were giants of their day and would have been close to the top of the food chain.  That makes it equivalent in importance to some of the top carnivores in modern oceans, such as sharks and seals back in the Cambrian period.\" The worms are thought to have been some of the largest swimming animals, when they roamed the seas more than 518 million years ago. Scientists think that the creatures were around for \"about 10 to 15 million years before they got superseded by other, and more successful, groups.\" Experts say they are \"very excited\" to have unearthed \"such unique predators\" and hope their discovery will help show how the earliest animal ecosystems looked like and evolved. \u00a9 2024 BBC.

    "content": "The research team analysed DNA and physical characteristics to describe two completely new species and move three subspecies to the level of species.  These   are different to the spiky ones we usually see because they are softer and furry.  This new discovery shows how even in well-studied animal groups, like mammals, there is still more to be uncovered.  The five new species belong to a group of soft-furred hedgehogs called lesser gymnures, that live in Southeast Asia and before it was thought there were only two species.  The study which made the discovery used modern techniques to examine the hedgehog specimens from museum collections.  The team looked at 232 physical specimens and 85 tissue samples for genetic analysis from across the entire soft-furred hedgehog group.  The results confirmed that there were then five new species.  The team is excited by the discovery because it shows there is still so much to learn about the natural world.  \"It might be surprising for people to hear that there are still undiscovered mammals out there. But there is a lot we don't know - especially the smaller nocturnal animals that can be difficult to tell apart from one another,\" said Melissa Hawkins, curator of mammals at The National Museum of National History, in the US.  Soft-furred hedgehogs are small mammals, but unlike the rest of the hedgehog family they are furry rather than spiky.  Arlo Hinckley, lead author of the study, says without the spiky spines, they look a bit more like a mix of a mouse and a shrew with a short tail.  These new species are active in the day and night and enjoy eating a diverse mix of insects and some fruits.  \"Based on the lifestyles of their close relatives and field observations these hedgehogs likely nest in hollows and take cover while foraging among tree roots, fallen logs, rocks, grassy areas, undergrowth and leaf litter,\" says Hinckley.  \u00a9 2024 BBC.

In trying to fix the issue the craft has lost \"critical\" amounts of fuel and time is running out to salvage anything from the mission, its engineers said. This video can not be played Watch: Vulcan rocket lifts off to the Moon Before encountering the fault, Peregrine launched successfully onboard a Vulcan rocket, that blasted off from Florida in the United States on Monday.  The lander is operated by private space company Astrobotic Technology. American space agency Nasa had paid for five pieces of scientific equipment to be carried onboard for experiments on the lunar surface. A successful landing, scheduled for 23 February, would have marked the  first time a private company had landed on the Moon's surface and would have been the first American made spacecraft on the surface of the Moon since the   17 mission in 1972. But that's no longer possible now and Astrobotic says it might not be able to control its spacecraft for much longer. Peregrine's problems were identified soon after communications had been established following its separation from the top of the Vulcan rocket.  Engineers noticed the spacecraft was struggling to maintain a stable lock on the Sun, meaning its solar cells were not receiving a constant supply of sunshine to recharge the onboard battery. Astrobotic's engineers eventually identified the cause as a failure in the propulsion system, and although they were able to successfully re-point the spacecraft and charge the battery, it was evident, the company said, that Peregrine had lost a significant amount of fuel in the process. As a result Astrobotic said it was reassessing its mission goals, which means looking at what could still be achievable in the circumstances. \"At this time the goal is to get Peregrine as close to lunar distance as we can before it loses the ability to maintain its Sun-pointing position and subsequently loses power,\" it said. Peregrine is just one of several spacecraft attempting to land on the lunar surface in 2024.

    "content": "The red-eyed, winged insects called periodical cicadas, emerge in 13 to 17-year cycles and are completely harmless. In 2024, two of these groups - called Brood XIII (meaning 13) and Brood XIX (19) - are predicted to burst from the ground together for the first time since 1803.  The US states of Wisconsin and Illinois will be mainly affected as billions of the bugs making a loud clicking noise will fill the air, cover branches, sign posts and pavements for about a month later this year. Cicadas are among some of the longest-living insects in the world, but spend most of their lives living underground feeding on tree roots. When they are ready to come to the surface, they build mud tubes - called a cicada hut - in the soil and crawl out to find a place to moult into their winged adult form. As many as 1.5 million of the insects can come out of the ground per acre of land, meaning that tens of billions in total will emerge. Once above ground, the insects live for just four to six weeks - one of the main reasons why they come out of the ground is to mate.  In order to attract females, male cicadas can make a loud clicking sound that has a noise level similar to a lawn mower or a passing jet plane.  The amount of eggs laid from adult cicadas can weigh down tree branches. Cicadas also feed on young trees and vines, and can cause significant damage in the process. The University of Illinois says that: \"When the cicadas start dying and dropping from the trees later in the spring, there are large numbers on the ground, and the odour from their rotting bodies is noticeable.  \"In 1990, there were reports from people in Chicago having to use snow shovels to clear their sidewalks of the dead cicadas.\" The next generation of Brood XIX will emerge from the ground in around 13 years in 2037, while Brood XIII has a 17-year cycle meaning they will re-emerge in 2041. \u00a9 2024 BBC.

Experts say that the turtle dove and the hazel dormouse are among those facing an uncertain future in the UK.  They added that factors such as  , intensive farming and pollution are all putting pressure on our wildlife. The State of Nature report was put together by more than sixty organisations, including wildlife conservation groups, government agencies and academics. It looked back at around fifty years of research and found that natural spaces and the wildlife that depends on them are in decline. Numbers of plants and animals monitored since the 1970s have decreased by an average 19%. Researchers say that the most at-risk groups included birds, amphibians and reptiles, fungi and land mammals.  Species affected include the turtle doves, water voles, lady's slipper orchids and European eels.  More than half of plant species have also declined and researchers have also warned that most of Britain's important natural habitats are in a poor condition - including woodland, wetlands and wildflower meadows. We need to move far faster as a society towards nature-friendly land and sea use.  Beccy Speight, RSPB chief executive The report found that intense farming and the effects of climate change, are having the biggest impacts on our wildlife.  At sea and on the coast, the main pressures on nature are unsustainable fishing, climate change and the way coasts and sea beds are looked after. Conservation organisations say more investment and a shift to much more wildlife-friendly farming and fishing are urgently needed. In England, an estimated 70% of land is farmed. Beccy Speight from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said that the report should make everyone \"sit up and listen\". Beccy also argued that restoring nature would also help to tackle the climate crisis: \"We need to move far faster as a society towards nature-friendly land and sea use. \"Otherwise, the UK's nature and wider environment will continue to decline and degrade, with huge implications for our own way of life.\" The government has said it is committed to \"increasing the amount of habitat for nature to thrive\". It added that it was investing in its \"30-by-30\" pledge, to protect 30% of land for nature by 2030. Currently only about 11% of UK land is within protected areas, and the report says not all of it is well managed for nature and wildlife. \u00a9 2024 BBC.

Phrases such as \"May the Force be with you\", will be spoken in the Ojibwe language for the first time on film and translates as \"Gi-ga-miinigoz Mamaandaawiziwin\". The University of Manitoba and the Dakota Ojibwe Tribal Council - which represents several first nation groups -  is working with Disney and Lucasfilm to accurately translate the movie into Anishinaabemowin with backing from the Canadian government.  It's hoped that translating the movie will help to preserve the Ojibwe language which is widely spoken in the Canadian province of Manitoba and Ontario and the US state of Minnesota.  Since it was first released in 1977, the Star Wars films have been translated into more than 50 languages.  In a similar move in 2013, the first movie in the saga,  Star Wars: A New Hope was the first major motion picture movie to be dubbed into the Navajo Native American language.  A recent university study has found that words from the Star Wars movies are often used as part of the English language.  The research by Chemnitz University of Technology in Germany suggests that people routinely use words such as: Yoda, Jedi, Padawan and lightsaber, and talk about turning to the 'dark side', when doing something bad.  \"I wanted to find out whether words from the 'Star Wars' universe have already become part of our own universe,\" says Prof Dr. Christina Sanchez-Stockhammer who adds that many phrases or characters are familiar to those who may not have seen the films.  \"'Star Wars'\" has become such an important part of popular culture that Yoda's role as a mentor or the appearance of lightsabers can be assumed to be familiar to large sections of the population.\" The Star Wars words and phrases were looked for in published texts as far back as the 1980s, as well as 11.5 million words recorded from conversations in British homes for another study on language which took place between 2012 and 2016. Sanchez-Stockhammer says 'Star Wars'-words often pop up more than many regular words, with no direct reference to movies at all. \"I've been a Star Wars fan for a long time, but really realised how important Star Wars has become in everyday language when the US politician Nancy Pelosi accused the former Speaker of the House of Representatives of going to the 'dark side'.\" Lightsaber, Jedi, and Padawan were added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2019, with Yoda included since 2016 and \"the dark side\" since 2021.  \u00a9 2024 BBC.

This goes into your gut, and after some impressive biological processes, becomes another substance.

    "content": "The research was done by Copernicus Climate Change Service, which studies the impact of climate change on our planet, and how temperatures are changing. This recent temperature boost is mainly linked to the El Ni\u00f1o weather conditions, which have occurred on top of long-term human-caused warming, and scientists from the Met Office - which predicts our weather - are concerned that 2024 could be even hotter.  The Met Office also reported last week that the UK experienced its second warmest year on record in 2023. Put simply, the Earth is heating up, with the report saying that July 2023 was likely the hottest month in the last 120,000 years.  The climate has changed throughout the Earth's history but natural causes cannot explain the particularly rapid warming seen in the last century, according to the UN's climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Scientists say these record temperatures were driven by human-caused climate change and boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather event. However, though natural factors like El Ni\u00f1o can raise or reduce temperatures for individual years, they say, the temperatures experienced in 2023 go far beyond simply natural causes. Scientists and campaigners have been asking leaders all over the world to put plans in place to cut emissions \"radically\" and slow down the rate of global warming.  These hotter temperatures have an impact all around the world. Arctic ice levels are low, and  In an historic event called the Paris Climate Agreement, countries all over the world agreed to stop climate change from heating Earth by more than 1.5C.  They were advised by scientists that a 1.5C was the highest rise the planet could cope with, without big consequences to people and wildlife. When fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas are burned, they release carbon dioxide.  This is called a greenhouse gas - it goes into the atmosphere and traps the Sun's rays, heating up the planet. \"These are more than just statistics,\" says Prof Petteri Taalas, the Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organization between 2016 and 2023. \"Extreme weather is destroying lives and livelihoods on a daily basis.\" This video can not be played Justin Rowlatt answers questions about the world's biggest climate meeting Despite the record temperatures, climate scientists are clear that action by countries around the world to limit the consequences of climate change can still make a difference. World leaders have been working with scientists to try to come up with a plan to tackle rising temperatures.  The news that 2023 is hottest on record comes after the COP28 climate summit in December where countries agreed for the first time on the need to tackle one of the main cause of rising temperatures - use of fossil fuels. However, reaching agreement on a way forward can be very difficult, as countries have different wants and needs. To reduce global warming, countries can cut down on their fossil fuel use and their carbon dioxide emissions.  To reduce the impact of climate change, governments can make buildings ready for storms and flooding, and educate people about looking after the environment. \u00a9 2024 BBC.

    "content": "Hundreds of Post Office workers were punished after faulty computer software they were using - called Horizon - made it look like money was going missing. Here's what happened, and why the Horizon Post Office scandal is in the news right now. Between 1999 and 2015, 736 Post Office workers - called sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - were wrongly convicted for stealing after a computer system muddled up calculations about the amount of money they were making in their individual branches.  In 1999, the Post Office introduced a new computer system called Horizon - created by tech company, Fujitsu.  But many staff complained that the computer system wasn't working properly. They said it often had tech issues and showed inaccuracies, sometimes adding up to thousands of pounds. A Post Office is a business that deals in the sending and receiving of mail.  Letters, parcels and official documents can be approved and sent via a Post Office. You can also buy stamps, packaging and greetings cards.  A sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress is a person who takes responsibility for the everyday running of a Post Office, including the money going in and out of the business.  But the Post Office insisted the errors could not be caused by the computer system and over 700 workers were accused of stealing or losing money from the business.  Some people were made to pay back the money and some even went to jail for a crime they did not commit.  Many of the accused had to use their own money to make up for the apparent losses, which they often couldn't afford. Many maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised issues about problems with Horizon. Some went to prison and others say they were treated criminals and liars and faced abuse from people who believed they had stolen the money. After 20 years, campaigners won a legal battle to have their cases looked at again but so far only 93 of the 736 convictions have been reversed. This Christmas, an ITV drama about the case has caused a lot of anger and put their story back in the headlines and forced politicians to respond. The TV drama has also led to more of pressure being on the Royal Mail and Fujitsu and their bosses about their role in the scandal. At the moment an investigation into what happened - called a public inquiry - is taking place and the government says those to blame will be \"held to account\".  Paula Vennell, a former top boss of the Post Office during the period in question - who was featured in the drama - has now said she will hand back her  , given to her in 2019 \"for services to the Post Office and to charity\". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak described the scandal as \"appalling\", saying: \"It's important that all those affected get the support they need, which I am pleased is happening and we will keep going as quickly as possible.\" Alex Chalk, the Justice Secretary, says he is \"actively considering\" introducing a brand new legal process to reverse the convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses caught up in the scandal.

Former London Welsh team-mate John Taylor was also his best man at his wedding and said \"he was amazing\". \"He actually revolutionised the idea of how a full-back should play,\" Taylor told BBC 5 Live Sport. \"He was unbelievable and the original attacking full-back.\" \u00a9 2024 BBC.

    "content": "The team already knew the ancient forest existed, but this is the first time it was properly investigated to find out the ages of plants and trees growing there.  The forest had evidence of some very early plants being there - some of these plants would have even been seen by dinosaurs.  The teams, from the University of Binghamton in the US and the University of Cardiff in Wales, think the forest used to spread around 400 kilometres, which is about 250 miles. The scientists discovered the forest at the bottom of a quarry in a place called Cairo, in the state of New York.  The mapping of the area started five years ago, back in 2019.  By looking at the fossils of different plants and trees found in the area, they discovered that it's the oldest forest found on Earth so far. Other extremely old forests include the Amazon rainforest and the Yakushima Forest in Japan. Their discovery involves the study of  means old, or ancient, and  is the study of plants - so it means studying ancient plants. You are walking through the roots of ancient trees Dr Christopher Berry, Paleobotanist, Cardiff University Unlike most of the trees we see today, the ancient trees seen in this forest would not have reproduced by releasing seeds that grow into a tree.  Many of the fossilised trees found in this forest would have reproduced using spores.  You might recognise that word from learning about fungi - which spread around and multiply by sending spores into the air.  \u00a9 2024 BBC.

The rare blonde hedgehog, which was has been admitted to a rescue centre in Highbridge, Somerset, weighs just 160 grams and is in need of a bit of looking after. If you are lucky enough to spot a hedgehog, they are often brown, but European hedgehogs can also be blonde as well. This video can not be played Meet the girls who rescue hedgehogs European hedgehogs are also known as common hedgehogs and are native to mainland Europe, and the United Kingdom and Ireland. Although overall the populations of these creatures are stable, they are decreasing in Great Britain where they are  , and the World Wildlife fund says hedgehogs \"have declined sharply\" in Switzerland over the last 25 years. Although most of the hedgehogs we see are brown,  or \"blonde\" hedgehogs occasionally occur.  The hedgehog population in Alderney, Channel Islands is actually around 25% blonde! This hedgehog has a genetic condition known as  , which can cause a partial loss of skin pigmentation and creamy-coloured spines.  They are very rare, except on North Ronaldsay and the Channel Island of Alderney. \"Although we don't see many leucistic hedgehogs in mainland Britain, around 25% of the hog population in Alderney on the Channel Islands are of the blonde variety.  \"This is not the first leucistic animal we have had at Secret World, last year we admitted a leucistic shrew that was a beautiful silver colour\" said SWWR Learning and Engagement Officer George Bethell. \u00a9 2024 BBC.

    "content": "The missions have been pushed back because the technology, such as suits and space craft used for parts of the journey, still isn't ready.  Artemis II was scheduled to launch later this year, but will now blast off in September 2025, at the earliest, and will involve a   travelling around the Moon and back again.  Artemis III, which plans to land Nasa astronauts on the Moon's surface for the first time in more than 50 years has been pushed back until 2026. Announcing the delay, Bill Nelson from Nasa said safety was a big part of the decision, saying: \"We won't fly until we're ready.\" Nasa's Artemis programme which has seen several delays already is expected to cost at least $93 billion (\u00a373 billion) and will send the  .  Its aims include studying  , eventually using the missions to begin construction of a   which will be used as a stepping stone for the first human journey to Mars.  The programme began with Artemis I which launched in 2022 and   the use of a giant Nasa rocket known as the   for short.  The uncrewed mission also put an Orion capsule, which Nasa will eventually use to house its astronauts, into to lunar orbit.  But before the four-person team of Artemis II can safely climb aboard Orion, the capsule needs its life-support system to be installed and Nasa says there are concerns about the electronics in this system that will now have to be changed.  Engineers also want more time to understand the behaviour and performance of the heatshield that protects the Orion capsule during the fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere at the end of a mission. This shield experienced some unexpected losses of material during the return of Artemis I. Once those issues have been sorted out, Nasa can turn its attention to actually getting astronauts onto the surface of the Moon for the  The Artemis III mission will work in partnership with businessman  's  private space company SpaceX, using a version of their huge  . The idea is for astronauts to be able to transfer themselves from the Orion capsule into Starship while in lunar orbit and then go down in it to the Moon's surface. SpaceX needs not only to get the new vehicle working properly but also to stage an uncrewed landing on the Moon itself.  And just getting Starship close enough to the Moon will require considerable effort. SpaceX needs to work out a way to refuel Starship while its in Earth orbit, something that has never been done before. Nasa associate administrator Jim Free was asked if it was realistic to think all this technology could be perfected by September 2026. \"We're setting a date for [Artemis III] that we have set with our contractors, based on the technical plans that they've laid out,\" he responded. \"We've tried to...set a realistic plan in place.\" As for Moon missions further into the future, plans for Artemis IV and V have not changed so far, and are still scheduled to blast off in 2028 and 2029 respectively. Artemis IV will see the first astronaut flight to the new   that will be constructed this decade.  Meanwhile Artemis V will see the use of a second Moon landing system called Blue Moon, developed by the   owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. \u00a9 2024 BBC.
